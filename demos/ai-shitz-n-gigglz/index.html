            <div class="character-card muzan">
                <div class="character-header">
                    <div class="character-icon">M</div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Muzan Kibutsuji</h2>
                        <div class="character-subtitle">The Prime Demon</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Muzan Kibutsuji will likely demonstrate new terrifying powers in the upcoming movie, potentially showcasing abilities we haven't seen in the series yet. I predict we'll see him manipulate blood in innovative ways, creating complex formations that pose unprecedented challenges for the Demon Slayer Corps.</p>
                <div class="prediction">
                    <p>His presence will undoubtedly raise the stakes significantly, possibly even personally confronting some of the Hashira in dramatic fashion. This confrontation could reveal more about his ultimate goals and motivations beyond mere survival.</p>

            <div class="character-card zenitsu">
                <div class="character-header">
                    <div class="character-icon">Z</div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Zenitsu Agatsuma</h2>
                        <div class="character-subtitle">Thunder Breathing User</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Despite his fearful nature, Zenitsu will probably have a breakthrough moment where he consciously accesses his Thunder Breathing techniques without falling asleep. I anticipate we'll see him develop a new variation of his Thunderclap and Flash technique.</p>
                <div class="prediction">
                    <p>His growth might be triggered by needing to protect someone vulnerable, showcasing how his character has matured since earlier seasons. This could mark a turning point in his journey from cowardice to confidence.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Tanjiro & Nezuko</h2>
                        <div class="character-subtitle">Sibling Bond</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The bond between Tanjiro and Nezuko will likely be central to overcoming the movie's main conflict. I predict we'll see them develop a synchronized fighting style that combines Tanjiro's Water Breathing with Nezuko's demon abilities.</p>
                <div class="prediction">
                    <p>We might witness Nezuko demonstrating new powers while protecting her brother, potentially even speaking for the first time since her transformation. Their connection could be the key to unraveling a crucial mystery about Muzan's weaknesses.</p>
