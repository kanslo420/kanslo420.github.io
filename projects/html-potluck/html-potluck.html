        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1 box Ghirardelli brownie mix.
                </li>
                <li>
                    12 Tablespoons of butter
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 cup brown sugar
                </li>
                <li>
                    1/2 cup granulated sugar
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 large egg

                <li>
                    2 teaspoons vanilla extract
                </li>
                <li>
                    2 cups of flour
                </li>
                <li>
                    1/2 teaspoon baking soda
                </li>
                <li>
                    1/2 teaspoon salt
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 1/2 cups chocolkate chips

            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line a 9×13 pan with 
                    parchment for easy clean-up and cutting. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prepare brownie mix according to package instructions 
                    and pour into prepared pan.  Do not bake yet. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    In your empty brownie bowl, add melted butter, sugar, 
                    brown sugar, egg and yolk, and vanilla an stir to 
                    combine.  Add flour, soda, and salt and stir.  
                    Finally fold in chocolate chips until just mixed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use your hands to drop flattened pieces dough onto the 
                    top of the brownie batter, it's okay if some brownie 
                    batter shows through and your cookie layer can be rough
                    and lumpy! 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake for 35-45 minutes until cookie part looks set and
                    evenly cooked. Poke a skewer or tooth pick in the 
                    middle to ensure you don't have wet batter on your 
                    brownie layer- moist crumbs and melted chocolate are 
                    okay though!
                    This can be a tricky step when you can't see the 
                    brownie layer. In my oven, with a Ghirardelli brownie 
                    mix, my bake time is always between 35-40 minutes 
                    (usually right at 40). All ovens bake differently so 
                    be sure to keep an eye on your pan and test with a 
                    toothpick in the center before you pull them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For best results, cool completely before cutting and 
                    serving. (Unless you're serving over ice cream, in 
                    which case, by all means scoop them up warm!)

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Pulse the granulated sugar into superfine sugar. 
                    Use a food processor or blender. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Set 1 cup of the superfine sugar aside. You’ll add it 
                    to the egg whites.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add cake flour and salt to food processor. 
                    Pulse them with the remaining sugar. This aerates the 
                    dry ingredients.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Beat egg whites and cream of tartar together. 
                    Beat on medium-low speed until foamy. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Slowly add 1 cup of superfine sugar. Turn the mixer up 
                    to medium-high and pour in the superfine sugar you set 
                    aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Beat into soft peaks. Whip the egg whites, cream of
                    tartar, and superfine sugar into soft and lofty peaks. 
                    This takes at least 5 minutes. After that, add the 
                    vanilla.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sift and fold in dry ingredients. In 3 additions,
                    sift and fold in the dry ingredients.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour/spread batter into a tube pan. Do not grease the 
                    tube pan. Greasing the pan causes the batter to slip 
                    down the sides, preventing it from properly rising. 
                    If you already greased it, wash and wipe it completely 
                    clean.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake at 325°F (163°C). A higher temperature won’t 
                    properly cook the cake.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cool upside down on a wire rack. If cooled upright, 
                    the cake’s own weight will crush itself. Cool it 
                    upside-down on a cooling rack so it holds its shape and
                    air can reach it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Run a thin knife around the edges to release. Tap 
                    the pan on the counter a few times to help loosen the 
                    cake, too. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Slice with a serrated knife. A regular sharp knife 
                    squishes the cake. 
                </li>

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm milk, 2 Tablespoons of
                    sugar, and the yeast together in the bowl of your stand 
                    mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. 
                    Cover and allow mixture to sit for 5–10 minutes or 
                    until foamy on the surface.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the remaining sugar and the butter and beat on medium 
                    speed until the butter is slightly broken up. Add about 1 
                    cup (125g) of the flour, the eggs, and salt and beat on 
                    low speed for 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the 
                    bowl, then add the remaining flour. Beat on medium speed 
                    until the dough comes together and pulls away from the 
                    sides of the bowl, about 2 minutes. Dough will be soft. 
                    If it seems too sticky and clings to the sides of the 
                    bowl instead of forming a rough mass around the dough 
                    hook or spoon, add more flour, 1 Tablespoon at a time, 
                    and continue to mix until the dough pulls away from the 
                    sides of the bowl but is still moist and tacky. If it 
                    feels dry and crumbly, add more milk, 1 teaspoon at a 
                    time, mixing well after each addition.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer 
                    (and switch to the dough hook if you used the paddle) 
                    and beat on low speed for an additional 5 full minutes,
                    or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 
                    full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How 
                    to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the 
                    dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, 
                    sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or
                    on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, 
                    slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you 
                    need because you do not want a dry dough. After 
                    kneading, the dough should feel smooth, supple, and 
                    elastic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    1st Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or butter 
                    (or use nonstick spray). Place the dough in the bowl, 
                    turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl 
                    with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the 
                    dough to rise at room temperature for 1 and 1/2 to 2 
                    hours or until doubled in size. (I always let it rise on
                    the counter and it takes about 2 hours.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Grease the bottom and sides of a 9×13-inch baking dish 
                    (glass or metal) or line it with parchment paper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Roll out the dough: Punch down the dough to release the 
                    air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and 
                    using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough into a 
                    12×18-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and 
                    evenly thick. If the dough keeps shrinking as you roll 
                    it out, stop what you’re doing, cover it lightly, and 
                    let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. When 
                    you return to the dough, it should stretch out much 
                    easier.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For the filling: Spread the softened butter all over the 
                    dough. The softer the butter is, the easier it is to 
                    spread in this step. (Microwave it for a few seconds to 
                    soften if needed.) In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar 
                    and cinnamon together. Sprinkle evenly over the butter. 
                    Tightly roll up the dough to form an 18-inch-long log. 
                    If some filling spills out, sprinkle it on top of the 
                    roll. With an extra-sharp knife, cut into 12 even rolls, 
                    about 1.5 inches thick. Arrange in the prepared baking 
                    pan.
                </li>
                <li>
                    2nd Rise: Cover the pan and allow the rolls to rise until
                    puffy, about 1 hour. (Or use the overnight option in the
                    Notes below.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C).
                </li>

                    Bake for about 25–28 minutes or until they are lightly 
                    browned on top, rotating the pan halfway through. If the 
                    tops are browning too quickly, loosely tent a piece of 
                    aluminum foil over the top of the pan. Remove pan from 
                    the oven and place pan on a cooling rack for about 10 
                    minutes while you make the icing.

                    Make the icing: In a large bowl using a handheld or 
                    stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, 
                    beat the cream cheese on medium speed until smooth and 
                    creamy. Add the confectioners’ sugar, cream/milk, and 
                    vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase
                    to high speed and beat for 1 minute. Spread the icing 
                    over the warm rolls and serve immediately.

                    Cover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and 
                    store at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the 
                    refrigerator for up to 5 days.
