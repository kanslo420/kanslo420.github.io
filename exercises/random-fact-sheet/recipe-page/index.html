        <h3>Dessert</h3>
        <h1>Japanese Creme Sanwiches</h1>
       
        <p>
            These deep-fried sandwiches are inspired by a viral Japanese shop 
            that had me absolutely hooked the moment I laid eyes on them. Golden,
            crispy but fluffy milk bread stuffed with whipped cream and
            strawberries or topped with custard and caramelized sugar for a 
            crème brûlée twist— what is there not to love? This is my version 
            of that dreamy dessert without the whole flight across the world 
            to Japan!

                <h2>MAKE THE CUSTARD (OPTIONAL)</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        In a medium saucepan, heat whole milk, vanilla extract, 
                        and salt over medium-low until just warm
                    </li>
                    <br>   
                    <li>
                        In a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch, sugar, 
                        and egg yolks until smooth. 
                    </li>
                    <br>    
                    <li>
                        Gradually pour the warm milk into the egg mixture
                        while whisking continuously to temper the eggs.
                    </li>
                    <br>     
                    <li>
                        Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat,
                        stirring constantly, until thickened to a custard-like 
                        consistency.
                    </li>
                    <br>     
                    <li> 
                        Remove from heat and stir in the butter until fully melted
                        and incorporated.
                    </li>
                    <br>     
                    <li>
                        Transfer the custard to a bowl, cover the surface with 
                        plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming, and chill in 
                        the refrigerator until completely cool 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <h3>MAKE THE WHIPPED CREAM</h3>
                 <li>
                        In a large mixing bowl, combine heavy cream, powdered sugar,
                        and vanilla extract.
                 </li>
                 <br>
                    <li>Whisk the mixture until stiff peaks form.</li>

                    <br>
                    <h3>FRY THE BREAD</h3>
                    <li>
                        Heat a shallow layer of vegetable oil in a large skillet 
                        over medium heat.
                    </li>
                     <br>   
                    <li>
                        Fry each slice of Japanese milk bread until golden and 
                        crispy on both sides, flipping carefully to prevent tearing
                    </li>
                    <br>    
                    <li> 
                    Transfer the fried bread to a plate lined with paper 
                    towels to absorb excess oil
                    </li>
                    <h3>ASSEMBLE THE SANDWICHES</h3>
                    For strawberry whipped cream sandwiches:
                    <li>
                        Cut each fried bread slice in half and gently open 
                        each piece to create a pocket.
                    </li>
                 <br>
                    <li>
                        Fill the pocket generously with whipped cream and top with 
                        three strawberry halves.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    For Crème Brûlée Sandwiches:
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Cut each fried bread slice in half and gently open 
                        each piece to create a pocket.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Fill the pocket about two-thirds of the way with 
                        whipped cream, leaving room for the custard.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Spoon custard into the remaining one-third of the pocket.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Sprinkle an even layer of granulated sugar over the custard
                        and brûlée it with a kitchen torch until caramelized 
                        and golden. Allow the caramelized sugar to cool and 
                        harden slightly before serving.
                    </li>
                </ol>
