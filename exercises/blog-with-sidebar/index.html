            <h3>Kitbutsuji , Muzan</h3>
            <img src="images/muzan_kibutsuji.jpeg">
              <p>
                Muzan Kibutsuji will likely demonstrate new terrifying 
                powers in the upcoming movie, potentially showcasing 
                abilities we haven't seen in the series yet. I predict 
                we'll see him manipulate blood in innovative ways, 
            </p>
              <p>
                creating complex formations that pose unprecedented 
                challenges for the Demon Slayer Corps. His presence 
                will undoubtedly raise the stakes significantly, 
                possibly even personally confronting some of 
                the Hashira in dramatic fashion.
            </p>
            <h3>zenitsu agatsuma</h3>
            <images src="images/zenetsu_.jpg">
               <p>
                Despite his fearful nature, Zenitsu will probably 
                have a breakthrough moment where he consciously accesses 
                his Thunder Breathing techniques without falling asleep. 
                I anticipate we'll see him develop a new variation
            </p>
              <p>
                of his Thunderclap and Flash technique that surpasses 
                anything he's demonstrated before. His growth might be 
                triggered by needing to protect someone vulnerable, 
                showcasing how his character has matured since earlier 
                seasons.
            </p>
            <h3>Nezuko and Tanjiro</h3>
            <img src="images/nezuko_tanjro.avif">
               <p>
                The bond between Tanjiro and Nezuko will likely be 
                central to overcoming the movie's main conflict. I predict 
                we'll see them develop a synchronized fighting style that 
                combines Tanjiro's Water Breathing with Nezuko's demon 
                abilities
            </p>
              <p>
               We might witness Nezuko demonstrating new powers while 
               protecting her brother, potentially even speaking for 
               the first time since her transformation. Their 
               connection could be the key to unraveling a crucial 
               mystery about Muzan's weaknesses.
